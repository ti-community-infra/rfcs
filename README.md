# TiDB community infra RFCs

RFCs for changes to TiDB community infra

## What is an RFC?

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a
consistent and controlled path for new features to enter the community infra.

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be
implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put
through a bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the TiDB community.

## The RFC life-cycle

An RFC goes through the following stages:

- **Pending:** when the RFC is submitted as a PR.
- **Active:** when an RFC PR is merged and undergoing implementation.
- **Landed:** when an RFC's proposed changes are shipped in an actual release.
- **Rejected:** when an RFC PR is closed without being merged.

## When to follow this process

You need to follow this process if you intend to make "substantial"
changes to one of the projects listed below:

- [tichi](https://github.com/ti-community-infra/tichi)
- [ti-challenge-bot](https://github.com/ti-community-infra/ti-challenge-bot)
- [ti-sync-bot](https://github.com/ti-community-infra/ti-sync-bot)

What constitutes a "substantial" change is evolving based on community norms, but may include the following:

- A new feature that creates new plugins or components
- Changing the semantics or behavior of an existing plugins or API
- The removal of features that are already shipped as part of the release channel

Some changes do not require an RFC:

- Additions that strictly improve objective, numerical quality criteria (speedup)
- Fixing objectively incorrect behavior
- Rephrasing, reorganizing or refactoring
- Addition or removal of logs
- Additions only likely to be _noticed by_ other implementors, invisible to users

If you submit a pull request to implement a new feature without going
through the RFC process, it may be closed with a polite request to
submit an RFC first.

## Why do you need to do this

It is great that you are considering suggesting new features or changes to TiDB community infra - we appreciate your willingness to contribute! However, as these tools becomes more widely used, we need to take stability more seriously, and thus have to carefully consider the impact of every change we make that may affect end users.

These constraints and tradeoffs may not be immediately obvious to users who are proposing a change just to solve a specific problem they just ran into. The RFC process serves as a way to guide you through our thought process when making changes to TiDB community infra, so that we can be on the same page when discussing why or why not these changes should be made.

## Gathering feedback before submitting

It's often helpful to get feedback on your concept before diving into the
level of API design detail required for an RFC. **You may open an
issue on this repo to start a high-level discussion**, with the goal of
eventually formulating an RFC pull request with the specific implementation
design.

## What the process is

In short, to get a major feature added to TiDB community infra, one must first get the
RFC merged into the RFC repo as a markdown file. At that point the RFC
is 'active' and may be implemented with the goal of eventual inclusion
into TiDB community infra.

- Fork the RFC repo https://github.com/ti-community-infra/rfcs

- Copy `0000-template.md` to `src/0000-my-feature.md` (where
  'my-feature' is descriptive. don't assign an RFC number yet).

- Fill in the RFC. Put care into the details: **RFCs that do not
  present convincing motivation, demonstrate understanding of the
  impact of the design, or are disingenuous about the drawbacks or
  alternatives tend to be poorly-received**.

- Submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the pull request template and open a corresponding discussion thread.

- Build consensus and integrate feedback in the discussion thread. RFCs that have broad support are much more likely to make progress than those that don't receive any comments.

- Eventually, the [core team] will decide whether the RFC is a candidate
  for inclusion in TiDB community infra.

- An RFC can be modified based upon feedback from the [core team] and community. Significant modifications may trigger a new final comment period.

- An RFC may be rejected after public discussion has settled
  and comments have been made summarizing the rationale for rejection. A member of the [core team] should then close the RFC's associated pull request.

- An RFC may be accepted at the close of its final comment period. A [core team] member will merge the RFC's associated pull request, at which point the RFC will become 'active'.

## Details on Active RFCs

Once an RFC becomes active then authors may implement it and submit the
feature as a pull request to the repo. Becoming 'active' is not a rubber
stamp, and in particular still does not mean the feature will ultimately
be merged; it does mean that the core team has agreed to it in principle
and are amenable to merging it.

Furthermore, the fact that a given RFC has been accepted and is
'active' implies nothing about what priority is assigned to its
implementation, nor whether anybody is currently working on it.

Modifications to active RFC's can be done in followup PR's. We strive
to write each RFC in a manner that it will reflect the final design of
the feature; but the nature of the process means that we cannot expect
every merged RFC to actually reflect what the end result will be at
the time of the next major release; therefore we try to keep each RFC
document somewhat in sync with the language feature as planned,
tracking such changes via followup pull requests to the document.

## Implementing an RFC

The author of an RFC is not obligated to implement it. Of course, the
RFC author (like any other developer) is welcome to post an
implementation for review after the RFC has been accepted.

An active RFC should have the link to the implementation PR listed if there is one. Feedback to the actual implementation should be conducted in the implementation PR instead of the original RFC PR.

If you are interested in working on the implementation for an 'active'
RFC, but cannot determine if someone else is already working on it,
feel free to ask (e.g. by leaving a comment on the associated issue).

## Reviewing RFC's

Members of the [core team] will attempt to review some set of open RFC
pull requests on a regular basis. If a core team member believes an RFC PR is ready to be accepted into active status, they can approve the PR using GitHub's review feature to signal their approval of the RFC.
